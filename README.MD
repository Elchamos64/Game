# Overview

This is a basic role play text based game using JAVA. The game uses basic JAVA features like:
- `ArrayList`
- `Classes`
- `Expressions`
- `Conditionals`
- `Loops`
- `Functions`

The idea behind writing this software is to understand better how to write code in JAVA while making a fun game!

Bellow is a video demonstration of the software:

# Development Environment

For this website I used JAVA. And as my code editor I used intellIJ IDEA 2024. I specifically chose this code editor because it's easy to use and faster to write JAVA code because it already comes with all the packages and extensions that you need to code in JAVA or Kotlin.
You also need to have some understanding of Object oriented programming due to the nature of the Java programming language.

# Useful Websites

To help me create this software I used many YouTube tutorials and AI tools like chatGPT bellow I leave some links:

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Java Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34)
- [IntellIJ IDEA download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

# Future Work

The software could use some more features, like:

- Adding more items to the game.
- Make the enemy choose its own action before the turn ends.
- Adding some story to the game to make it interesting.
